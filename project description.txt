Problem definition

Adyen is looking to help a large Food ordering merchant optimize its risk settings. 
Adyen has a Rule Based Risk Engine with 78 different rules. 
A merchant can assign a score to each of the rules, if the combined score of the rules passes a threshold of 100, 
Adyen's risk engine will automatically block the transaction.
The merchant has asked us if we could determine the optimal risk score for them. 
What is important for them is that the chargeback rate should at all time stay below 1%, a chargeback costs them 15 EUR, +50% of the price of the
order while declining a transaction that turned out to be non-fraudulent (false positive) also costs them 50% of the price of the order (in the form 
of missed revenue). 

Data overview

* creationdate - date of transaction 
* bin - Bank Identification Number - The first 6 digits of a credit card that identify what bank issued the card
* checks - Array of booleans where 1 indicates that the check triggers
* amount - Order amount in Euros
* declined - If the issuer declined the transaction
* fraud_refusal - If the transaction was blocked by Adyenâ€™s risk engine (which runs before we send it to the issuer)
* fraud - If the transaction came back as a fraudulent chargeback (which means the transaction was approved)
* If both declined and fraud_refusal are 0, then the transaction was approved

Your task

* Analyse the data (preferably in R or Python) and find the 'optimal' risk scores.
* Create a 2/3 slide presentation on your approach and include a slide where you would show how you would solve this given more time.
* Share your code for discussion

Tips

* Think about what part of the dataset to use and how you are using it.
* You have limited time, stick to relatively simple ML Algorithms.
